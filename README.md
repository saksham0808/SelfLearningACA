My ACA Project on Self-learning

Script 'leastsquare' analyses data files in Data folder and classifies them, and returns the number of points wrongly classified.
Of the 20000 points in the data files, around 600-700 points are wrongly classfied at gaussian noise 100, and around 70-80 at gaussian noise 80, which was as expected.

Gen2PtData.py takes an integer input and gives a gaussian data around 2 points in the plance.
GenFxnData.py is intended to give points around a function with gaussian noise.
