Script 'regression' in Attempt1 analyses data files in Data folder and classifies them, and returns the number of points wrongly classified.
Of the 20000 points in the data files, around 600-700 points are wrongly classfied, which was expected as the standard deviation of the noisy data was taken to be very large.

Gen2PtData.py takes an integer input and gives a gaussian data around 2 points in the plance.
GenFxnData.py is intended to give points around a function with gaussian noise.
